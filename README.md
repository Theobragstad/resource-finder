# Resource-Finder

This is a placeholder repository for a mobile app idea that connects both recently released inmates and homeless people who want to improve their situation with a compilation of helpful plans/local resources/maps to help them transition back into society and get on the right track.

It will be optimized for low-cost devices so that it could potentially be economically distributed via mobile phones, such as by a local government program or nonprofit organization, and will have an enhanced offline mode.
